## First Project
Created a program that simulated diﬀraction-limited images, and ﬁt Point Spread Functions to the images using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The purpose of this research was to explore ways to overcome the diffraction limit with computer programming. Currently, the code that I have stored for this project is not operational.

## Second Project
Studied the chaos of three different simulated systems. They were a single damped pendulum, an orbit consisting of a planet and a satellite both orbiting the sun, and a double pendulum. We would record the x and y coordinates, the x velocity and the y velocity. The recorded data was graphed against each other ex: x vs. x velocity. We also used a box plot to determine the fractal dimension of the data.
