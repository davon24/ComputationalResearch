# First Project
Created a program that simulated diﬀraction-limited images, and ﬁt Point Spread Functions to the images using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The purpose of this research was to explore ways to overcome the diffraction limit with computer programming. Currently, the code that I have stored for this project is not operational.
